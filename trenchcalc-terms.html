  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: July 13, 2025</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TrenchCalc mobile application ("App"), developed by EngSite Tools.
    By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
  <p>
    TrenchCalc is designed to assist civil engineers and construction professionals in estimating trench fill volumes, cement requirements, and other related calculations. It is intended as a helpful estimation tool only.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not provide engineering or safety advice. You are solely responsible for verifying all results and ensuring compliance with local standards and site-specific requirements. EngSite Tools accepts no liability for decisions made based on the outputs of this App.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Some features of the App may require a paid subscription. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription entitlements. All billing is handled through Google Play, and we do not store or process your payment information directly.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Account Management</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete your account at any time from the Profile screen. Doing so will remove your authentication data. No project data is stored in the cloud, so deletion is instant and final.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All code, content, designs, and logos within the App are the property of EngSite Tools. You may not reproduce or redistribute any part of the App without prior written permission.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    EngSite Tools shall not be liable for any loss, injury, or damage resulting from the use of this App. All use is at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. If we do, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
