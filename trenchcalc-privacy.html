  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: July 13, 2025</p>

  <p>
    TrenchCalc ("the app") is a utility tool designed for engineering professionals to calculate trench volumes and backfill estimates. We value your privacy and only collect the minimum data necessary to deliver core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: When you sign in, we use AWS Cognito to securely manage your login using your email address.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases</strong>: We use RevenueCat to manage your subscription status. We do not receive your payment details directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Feedback</strong>: If you delete your account, you may optionally leave feedback. This is stored anonymously and cannot be linked back to your identity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not store any trench calculation data in the cloud.</li>
    <li>We do not access your device location, contacts, or files.</li>
    <li>We do not show ads or track you across other apps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete your account at any time from the profile screen. This removes all login data from our authentication system. Anonymous feedback, if submitted, is not linked to your user ID and cannot be deleted.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AWS Cognito – for secure authentication</li>
    <li>RevenueCat – for managing in-app subscriptions</li>
  </ul>
